# Walkable-Cities

## Project Overview
This is a comprehensive machine learning application that predicts location walkability scores using geographical coordinates. The system was developed through rigorous analysis of over 80 cities, evenly split between walkable and unwalkable examples, to evaluate urban infrastructure including sidewalks, road design, and public transportation accessibility.

## Research Methodology
The model was developed through extensive research examining over 80 cities worldwide, with balanced representation between walkable and unwalkable urban environments. Each city was evaluated based on critical pedestrian infrastructure:
1. Sidewalk Quality: Coverage, maintenance, and accessibility
2. Road Design: Pedestrian crossings, traffic calming measures, and safety features
3. Public Transportation: Integration, frequency, and proximity to walkable areas
4. Urban Planning: Mixed-use development and pedestrian-friendly zoning

## Validation and Testing
The tool has been validated through real-world applications across diverse urban landscapes, ensuring it provides meaningful walkability insights for urban planners, real estate professionals, and community developers. The comprehensive training dataset ensures reliable predictions across different city types and geographical regions.
